For taking me without knowing my reputation; trusting that the Lord had brought me to your doors for you to give me a gift I have always refused. Allowing what looks and speaks and professes to be a snake - and Faithfully executing His word, showing His love toward his greatest of enemies. I am gratefully Defeated.

Bless You All, in Jesus name.

An addendum: Thank you especially; Cassidy Feilds. Speaking the Spirit is all you need do. Keep going.
