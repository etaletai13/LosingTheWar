One of the biggest contentions even among Christians and different denominations; and even sometimes a rift under one roof of God's house; the question of the godhood of Jesus. This isn't going to be a long post, because there just isn't very much to be said. It all comes down to this:

"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the Father but through Me." and "If you have seen me, you have seen the Father." -- He was claiming outright to be God himself in the flesh, God Jesus; Christ Jesus; the Father, the Son; and he lives on in us today as the Holy Spirit. So the answer, you see, is a resounding Yes. Why? Because you are Christian, the answer is Yes ... now, looking at this all rationally, you have two options. Either Jesus of Nazereth was the most insane person ever - thus those religions that call Jesus a prophet cannot also say he was a good man, no man claiming to be God is good. That means either he's the most crazy person in history, or the worst of all liars, or ...

Jesus is exactly who he said he is. And every word he ever spoke was the end-all-be-all Truth. Simple, right?
