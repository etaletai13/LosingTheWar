This past Sunday, I was baptized. I went to the local Southern Baptist Convention church, and had the entire full-immersion and public spectacle. So I'll take this time to remind you all and remind myself that this act is in no way to glorify oneself, 'oh look to me, I have done such a thing!!'. No, rather, you are supposed to be outright BOASTING and bragging; about Jesus Christ. About your own weakness. About every little thing you see that you know was sent by Him, for his enjoyment, for his smiles, for his heart to be warmed, by the things you show him through your own eyes.

So ... let his eyes remain innocent; and let him forget those things you show him that he should not see. May they all be washed away, as they are Your sins.
